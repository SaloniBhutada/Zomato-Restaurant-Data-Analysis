# Zomato-Restaurant-Data-Analysis
The basic idea behind this project was to analyze each restaurant's performance on Zomato. The dataset from Kaggle provided numerous characteristics for judging a restaurant based on ratings, votes, location, cuisines, and so on, through which we were able to effectively perform Exploratory Data Analysis in R Studio and transform all of the business questions into findings.
